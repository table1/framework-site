## Overview

Framework manages your project's R package dependencies through `settings.yml`. When you call `scaffold()`, packages are automatically installed and loaded.

## Configuring Packages

In your `settings.yml`:

```yaml
packages:
  - name: dplyr
    auto_attach: true
  - name: ggplot2
    auto_attach: true
  - name: jsonlite
    auto_attach: false
```

### auto_attach

- `true`: package is loaded automatically when you call `scaffold()`
- `false`: package is installed but not loaded (use `library()` when needed)

## How It Works

When `scaffold()` runs:

1. Checks which packages are missing
2. Installs missing packages
3. Loads packages with `auto_attach: true`

You don't need to write `library()` calls for attached packages.

## Version Pinning

Pin specific versions or install from GitHub:

```yaml
packages:
  - name: dplyr
    version: "1.1.0"
    auto_attach: true

  - name: mypackage
    source: github
    repo: "username/mypackage"
    auto_attach: true

  - name: devpackage
    source: github
    repo: "username/devpackage"
    ref: "develop"
    auto_attach: false
```

## renv Integration

Framework detects if your project uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) and routes installations through it automatically.

To enable renv in a new project, configure it in your defaults via `setup()` or enable it per-project:

```r
renv::init()
```

When renv is active:
- Packages install to the project library
- `renv.lock` tracks exact versions
- Projects are isolated from your global library
