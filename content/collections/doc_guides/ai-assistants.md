## Overview

Framework generates and maintains context files for AI coding assistants, giving them project-specific knowledge about your Framework environment, data catalog, and directory structure.

## Supported Assistants

Framework supports three AI assistant configurations:

- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's IDE-focused assistant (`CLAUDE.md`)
- **GitHub Copilot**: Complements VS Code and JetBrains editors (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- **Multi-Agent**: Shared instructions for OpenAI Codex, Cursor, and other orchestrators (`AGENTS.md`)

Configure which assistants receive context files in the GUI under **AI Assistants**:

```r
framework::setup()
```

## Canonical Context File

The canonical file is your source of truth. Choose one format as primary—Framework mirrors its content to other assistant files when sync hooks run.

Options: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

## Context Templates

Framework provides a default template that gives AI assistants deep knowledge of your project. The template includes:

- Framework conventions and best practices
- Your project's directory structure
- Data catalog entries from `settings.yml`
- Installed packages and their purposes
- Project-type-specific guidance

Sections marked with `@framework:regenerate` are automatically updated when your project changes, while your custom notes are preserved.

You can customize the template under **Templates** in the GUI, but the default is designed to make assistants highly effective with Framework projects out of the box.

## Keeping Files in Sync

If you enable multiple assistants, use the **Sync AI Files Before Commit** hook to keep them synchronized:

```yaml
git:
  hooks:
    ai_sync: true
```

When you commit, Framework copies content from your canonical file to the others, ensuring all assistants have identical instructions.

## Regenerating Context

Update the auto-generated sections when your project changes:

```r
ai_regenerate_context()
```

This refreshes directory structure, data catalog entries, and package lists while preserving any custom notes you've added.
